OTHER GAME TODO
===============


----------------------------------------------
  DOOM 64
----------------------------------------------

!!  transition to make levels for Doom64 EX, not the TC.

    +  need to create the different WAD format
    +  need to bundle the special glbsp-based node builder
    +  need to pack created wad files into the final wad

+  a new theme (Urban / Hell) 


----------------------------------------------
  HACX
----------------------------------------------

+  complete the MATERIALS table

-  finish the ENTITIES table (trees etc)


----------------------------------------------
  CHEX QUEST
----------------------------------------------

+  finish Chex 3 MATERIALS table (the "XX" stuff)

+  implement basic theme for Chex 2 and Chex 3

-  make some good themes :)

-  ensure that Oblige logos work in all games

?  a pwad with textures/flats to smooth out compat issues
   and make certain materials more usable.


----------------------------------------------
  DUKE NUKEM 3D
----------------------------------------------

!!  get it working again

!  exit buttons

!  Oblige logos: create 'TILES020.ART' lump

+  merge sectors where possible:
   -  same properties on both sides
   -  the removed walls form a single chain (not separate)

+  monsters
+  weapons
+  health and ammo

+  working doors
+  keys and switches

-  fake 3D bridges (created via sprites)


----------------------------------------------
  QUAKE
----------------------------------------------

!!  get it working again
    1. support loading ".map" files as prefabs
    2. create ".map" file for the level
    3. invoke Quake map compiling tools

+  slopes!
   -  for clipping, force a node line where slope flattens out,
      then mark one side as sloped - other side as flat.

+  better texture alignment

+  better miptex handling:
   -  support multiple WD2 files : gui.quake_add_textures
   -  create OBLIGE logos : gui.quake_make_logo()

+  flame cages

-  texture coord system (see docs/Tex_Coords.txt)

DONE: for the missing WAD message: a clickable hyperlink

-  support colored lighting (FitzQuake, Darkplaces, etc).
   - add an entry in the pack called "maps/xxx.lit", which
   - it should contain: QLIT 1 0 0 0 <data>

-  support fog: in worldspawn put: "fog" "density R G B"
   (requires FitzQuake or Darkplaces)

-  LAVA: style=5, have "lava light" similar to "sun light"

-  support the Boss maps (next map = "start")
     E2M6 : wood floor, funky bridge, kill vores to get rune
     E3M6 : castley, lavay, teleport-in fiend
     E4M7 : blue maze, spawn, kill vores to get rune

-  better exits

-  CalcPoints : move edges inwards by 2 pixels

-  visibility: support diagonals, check if any sides in a cluster
               touch or cross a line between corners.

-  nail/spike shooters FTW : good in hallways

-  create faces from stacked brushes behind a gap (cf. oa_dm7)

DONE:  module to create _debugging_ MAP file

-  Option for shrinking textures by half (scaled in-map)
   which would only require 1/4 of the lightmap space
   (and hence less likely to run out of it)

-  convert the Quake_test() function into a prefab

?  create dummy .lit files for FitzQuake & DarkPlaces
   -  gui.pak_add_binary_lump

?  keys are removed after use : re-use them ??


----------------------------------------------
  QUAKE II
----------------------------------------------

!!  get it working again

+  proper hub system

-  create oblige logos (.wal entries)
